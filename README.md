# Simple Local RAG Tutorial

Local RAG pipeline we're going to build:

!["This is a flowchart describing a simple local retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow for document processing and embedding creation, followed by search and answer functionality. The process begins with a collection of documents, such as PDFs or a 1200-page nutrition textbook, which are preprocessed into smaller chunks, for example, groups of 10 sentences each. These chunks are used as context for the Large Language Model (LLM). A cool person (potentially the user) asks a query such as "What are the macronutrients? And what do they do?" This query is then transformed by an embedding model into a numerical representation using sentence transformers or other options from Hugging Face, which are stored in a torch.tensor format for efficiency, especially with large numbers of embeddings (around 100k+). For extremely large datasets, a vector database/index may be used. The numerical query and relevant document passages are processed on a local GPU, specifically an RTX 4090. The LLM generates output based on the context related to the query, which can be interacted with through an optional chat web app interface. All of this processing happens on a local GPU. The flowchart includes icons for documents, processing steps, and hardware, with arrows indicating the flow from document collection to user interaction with the generated text and resources."](images/simple-local-rag-workflow-flowchart.png)

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.

It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).

Each step can be roughly broken down to:

* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.
* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).
* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt.

## Why RAG?

The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.

Two primary improvements can be seen as:
1. **Work with custom data** - Many foundational LLMs are trained on vast amounts of internet text, giving them strong language modeling capabilities. However, they often lack detailed or specialized knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this by supplying LLMs with domain-specific information—like medical data or internal company documents—allowing their responses to be tailored for particular applications.
2. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are powerful, but they can sometimes produce responses that appear accurate but are actually incorrect—this is known as hallucination. RAG pipelines help reduce this issue by supplying LLMs with reliable, retrieved information, leading to more accurate responses. Moreover, since the information comes from specific sources, users can trace and verify the origin of the generated answers.

## What kind of problems can RAG be used for?

RAG can help anywhere there is a specific set of information that an LLM may not have in its training data (e.g. anything not publicly accessible on the internet).

For example you could use RAG for:
* **Customer support Q&A chat** 
* **Email chain analysis** 
* **Company internal documentation chat** 
* **Textbook Q&A**

All of these have the common theme of retrieving relevant resources and then presenting them in an understandable way using an LLM.

## Key terms

| Term | Description |
| ----- | ----- | 
| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, "hello, world!" could be split into ["hello", ",", "world", "!"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |
| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |
| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |
| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text "hello, world!", a genertive LLM may produce "we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |
| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |
| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of "[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like "may output" are used). |
